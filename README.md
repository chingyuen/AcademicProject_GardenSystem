AcademicProject_GardenSystem
============================
STM32 (ARM Cortex-M4)
Sustainable self-watering garden system

This is a past project for embedded system class in my Senior year.
It involved lot of planning, budgeting and testing. Given 5-6 weeks to 
complete the project with a partner. 

The system is able to gather moisture data from the soil and send it wirelessly
to a LCD screen and display a graphical information. Constantly monitoring the moisture
of the soil, whenever the moisture is low, it will triger the water pump and keep running it
until the desire level.

For more weekly progress for the project and see the powerpoint, please go to progress/ppt folder.
