Team Project Progress Report
Ching Yuen Ng/ Brian Rak
Week 4

Summary of Progress:

This week we got the pump working, the lower power mode working, and we were
able to detect the PWM signal for the current on the board.  We plan to use
the PWM to detect the battery usage to give us an estimate if the board is
charging or running out of power.
The application is also nicely modularized and we can test the it very quickly
now.  It should be fairly straightforward to finish it up.  We need to test
everything significantly but we should be all set.


Weekly progress:
- Got the Sleep Mode working (tenatively)
- Modularized the Application for the outside STM
-have the pump motor working, able to set or reset a bit to turn on/off the motor
-set up power estimate files, getting signals but need more work.


Challenges:
- It was really challenging working on the Sleep Mode.  I didn't really know
  what I was doing for the most part, but after a lot of study I began to
  partially understand what I was doing.  The part I was stuck on this week
  mostly revolved around the NVIC interrupts.  I did not know the interrupt
  was firing, but apparently it was working this whole time, but it was not
  being reset.  As soon as we reset the interrupt, it was able to come out of
  sleep mode and go back in at regular intervals.  There still appears to be
  some crashing over sustained periods, but the board works and it is
  glorious.

- It is really confusing when first setting up the wires for the motor, because 
  the motor driver is able to do many things depending how you wire it up and 
  setting the bits. Such as make the motor running forward or backward, free wheeling or in sleep mode.

- For the power estimate, we need to use A2D to get the signals, but we have been 
  using a A2D for the moisture sensor already, so that we have to seperate the power 
  signal and the moisture signals by using different channels, still need to work on it.


Planned work for following week:
- Enhance Nordic protocol to include timestamps
- Enhance Nordic error checking if no receiver is available so it doesn't
  crash
- Test and debug sleep mode
- Test the pump and develop a scheduling routine for the pump flow
- Set up the garden
- modify the LCD function to display the power estimate
- set the time for inside_stm board from receiving the info from outside_stm
- enchant LCD dispay for final prototype
- wire up the solar panel to the rechargerablr battery 
- testing all the functions by taking two stms to outdoor
- set up the garden
