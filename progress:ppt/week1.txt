Team Project Progress Report
Ching Yuen Ng/ Brian Rak
Week 1

Summary of Progress:

This week was a pretty good week for us.  Ching was carrying most of the load
this week, since Brian was pretty busy and got ill.  Most of the problems
revolved around hardware, as it took us some time to gather all of our
equipment.  Once we got our STM, moisture sensor, LCD, and nordic all working
properly, the software seemed to come fairly quickly.  LCD code was used from
the previous lab and we were able to get access to the previous digital
systems lab for our DAC and analog to digital converter.  
For the moisture sensor, we are getting correct values from it. But we haven't
got a chance to test the highest possible value (put it in water). Overall it 
is working great, very responsive.
We are going well as we planned and there is nothing changed about the block 
diagram for now. We have attached the powerpoint in the folder but nothing 
has to be changed.


Weekly progress:
- Went to store and bought aquaponics equipment
- Wrote LCD code to drive the LCD
- Wrote code to get moisture data
- Assembled main file for indoor stm/outside stm
- Went to store and bought aquaponics equipment
- Set up repository/makefiles for project
- Wrote driver file for dac/timer2/a2d


Challenges:
- We could not get our second STM to download code onto the board it took a very
  long time to diagnose the problem.  We originally thought the LCD was the
  issue, but it was actually the STM itself.
- For buying the aquaponics stuff, it was a little difficult to get the right
  type of equipment for the right type of plant.  For example, some plants
  needed to be watered more frequently than other plants.  Other plants did
  not need as much watering.  As a result, we found ourselves getting a
  recommendation from the florist.  We will have to see if our gravel will work
  properly with the plant and will not drain the water too quickly.


Planned work for following week:
- Get nordic code working
- Get Low Power mode working
- Gather materials for pump circuit
- Enhance LCD application
